[![Snakemake](https://img.shields.io/badge/snakemake-â‰¥8.14.0-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io)

This repository contains the code for my master thesis. A few python scripts, to download data files, some notebooks, mostly for experiments, and most importantly a snakemake pipeline that can be used to reproduce the results of the thesis. The pipeline can be run on a local machine or on in cluster environment, but be aware that some of the tools are **very** memory hungry.
